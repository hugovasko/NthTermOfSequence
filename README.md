# NthTermOfSequence
C# program which finds the n-th term of a sequence.
A user is prompted to enter the term index and the program will output the value of the term.
First three terms are predefined as 2, 4, 6 and every next term is calculated by the formula:
Ti = 3 * Ti-3 + 4 * Ti-2 - 7 * Ti-1  (T - term and i - index of the term).
